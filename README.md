### GitHub Description

Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction

Description:
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, family size, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger survived the disaster.

Features:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features like Title, FamilySize, and IsAlone.
- Data Visualization: Exploring data distributions and relationships with matplotlib and seaborn.
- Modeling: Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- Model Evaluation: Using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters with Grid Search.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script: python Titanic.py
